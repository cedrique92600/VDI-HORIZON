2.1	Machine creation

In this part, we will consider creation of machine virtual Ubunt.

2.1.1	Prerequisite 

Version : Ubuntu 20.04 x64

vSphere : 6.5 or later

Horizon Connection Server

2.1.2	VM Setting 

vCPU : 2 minimum

Memories : 2 RAM min

Network : Verified DNS -> to resolve the name of Domain


2.1.3	Display Setting

We must install a display desktop named “Gnome Desktop”, it’s mandatory. 

Apt-get upgrade
Apt-get update
apt-get install ubuntu-gnome-desktop

2.1.4	Dependency Packages

o	VM-Tools :

VM must communicate with vSphere to monitor and have information on VM. VM-tool allow to do that.

apt-get install open-vm-tools-desktop

o	Change Hostname

For Ubuntu, we must change the machine name 

Nano /etc/hosts | 127.0.0.1 hostname.domainname hostname

o	Dependency Packages :

Master Linux need packages before installing Horizon Agent

apt-get install python python-dbus python-gobject

2.1.5	Active Directory 

For instant-clone and Ubuntu OS, the solution is PSIBO.

PSIBO allow an authentication with our domain controller.

o	Link for download

https://github.com/BeyondTrust/pbis-open/releases

o	Install PSIBO on your Linux virtual machine

wget “link.deb.sh“
Chmod +x 
./pbis
Cd /opt/pbis/bin
Domainjoin-cli join -disable ssh DOMAIN user

o	Configuration user environment 

The netbios name of your AD
/opt/pbis/bin/config UserDomainPrefix [Domain]

The setting is for a single AD to allow connected automatically without to indicate domain name.
/opt/pbis/bin/config AssumeDefaultDomain True

User uses bash to connect 
/opt/pbis/bin/config LoginShellTemplate /bin/bash
If several domains have configured not to do this commande. User will have to indicate the domaine. The setting is configurable in /etc/vmware/viewagent-custom.conf.

Create a folder during the connection 
opt/pbis/bin/config HomeDirTemplate %H/%U

Edit file common-session in /etc/pamd.d/. To change PAM Authentification stack.
session sufficient pam_lsass.so -> session [success=ok default=ignore] pam_lsass.so
